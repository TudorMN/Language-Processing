# Language Processing

These projects deal with the fundamental aspects of the computer language translation process, studying specific techniques for the design of programming language compilers, which can be used for the processing of other types of computer languages.

## Projects

### 1. Top-down Recursive Descent Parser

The project's goal is to implement a Top-down Recursive Descent Parser, using Java as the source language.

### 2. SLR Parser

The project's goal is to implement a Simple LR Parser, using Java as the source language.

### 3. Recursive Descent Translator

The project's goal is to implement a Recursive Descent Translator, using Java as the source language, which is able to translate from a language similar to Pascal to another similar to C.

### 4. Bison/Flex Ascent Translator

The project's goal is to implement an Ascent Translator which must be able to carry out the same translation as in assignment 3, but using Bison and Flex as the main tools for implementation.
